With over 8 years of proven expertise as a Senior Full Stack Developer, I specialize in designing, developing, and optimizing web-based applications. My technical proficiency spans across Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI, and database technologies like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy. I have a deep understanding of API development and deployment using modern frameworks and cloud services.

I have successfully architected and maintained scalable, secure systems, leveraging AWS services like S3, EC2, Load Balancers, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and Cloudflare for infrastructure management. My experience in CI/CD pipelines using AWS, GitHub, and CodePipeline ensures seamless code integration and deployment, delivering high-quality applications with agility.

A key highlight of my career is the development of robust security modules in Python to prevent SQL injection, brute force attacks, and reverse engineering to protect against online scams. I have built and managed critical APIs with Django/Flask and developed clear, comprehensive product documentation.

In addition to my backend expertise, I bring strong skills in Docker for containerized applications and Kafka, Redis, and RabbitMQ for managing real-time data streams and messaging queues, making me highly adept at building scalable, performance-driven systems.

My work extends to WordPress development, where I've created custom themes, and plugins, and integrated complex third-party tools like LearnDash, ThriveCart, and ActiveCampaign. I am also experienced in site optimization, improving performance and SEO through Google Pagespeed, and implementing analytics via Google Tag Manager.

I thrive in collaborative environments, continuously pushing boundaries with cloud administration, backend development, and cutting-edge technologies. Whether it's deploying to AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean, I am always looking for innovative ways to enhance application performance and deliver exceptional user experiences.
